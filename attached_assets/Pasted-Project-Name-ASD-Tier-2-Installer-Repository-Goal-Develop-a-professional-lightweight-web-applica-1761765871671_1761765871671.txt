Project Name: ASD Tier 2 Installer Repository

Goal:
Develop a professional, lightweight web application that connects to the GitHub repository
👉 https://github.com/ASD-T2/ASD_Installer-repo

to list available installer files for authorized team members to download.

🧠 Core Requirements

Platform: Web
Hosting: Free Replit hosting (no Always-On, no paid plans)
Connectivity: Online (internet required)
Storage: No binaries or installers stored on Replit; all files are hosted in GitHub.

🎨 Interface & Design

Create a clean, professional dashboard showing all installers in a structured, user-friendly way:

Columns or cards for:

File name

Description (if available)

Version number (if in filename or metadata)

Download button (links to GitHub raw file)

Responsive layout using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

Optional: add a search/filter bar to find installers quickly.

🔐 Authorization

Restrict access so only approved users can download:

Implement simple username/password login (store credentials securely in Replit Secrets).

After successful login, show the installer list page.

Unauthorized users see a login form only.

🔗 GitHub Integration

Use the GitHub REST API to list installer files dynamically.
Example endpoint:

https://api.github.com/repos/ASD-T2/ASD_Installer-repo/contents/


Parse and display file metadata (name, type, download URL).

“Download” buttons should link directly to the file’s raw URL (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASD-T2/ASD_Installer-repo/main/filename.exe).

⚙️ Technical Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (Bootstrap/Tailwind)

Data Source: GitHub API

Auth: Flask session-based login; credentials stored as environment variables

Deployment: Default Replit “Run” setup; minimal server load; compatible with free tier

🌍 Language Settings

Replit Agent Interaction: English

Application Interface: English

📝 Additional Notes

The project must stay within Replit’s free compute limits.

Avoid heavy dependencies or background workers.

No database required — read-only access to GitHub content is enough.

Ensure the app launches with a single app.py file entry point.

✅ Optional Future Enhancements

Admin panel to refresh or sync installer list manually.

GitHub OAuth login for seamless access control.

Version grouping or changelog display per installer.
